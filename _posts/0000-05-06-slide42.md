<section markdown="1">  
“strong” colors (high saturation, middle value) activate negative space (whitespace)
Consider color contrasts.  
1 B&W is actually harder on the eyes/harder to read then white & dk grey.   
2 Strong colors will overwhelm weaker ones, which can be imputed to align with importance or add’l interpretation (which may be unintentional / incorrect)  
3 Super-strong colors (fire engine red, neon orange) are to be avoided unless there is a specific STRONG reason for using such a strong color
